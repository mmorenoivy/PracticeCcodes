# PracticeCcodes
Codes written in C#, console output only

Instead of using ticks for date/time, I used list strings for comparison of dates. The code has an existing date/time string and store dates in start and end lists, then determine which of the start date has the earliest date and which end date has the latest. This is my practice code for my selenium with C# project - determine and verify start and end dates of an event should fulfill the requirements:
 - start date of an event should capture the earliest date of an item
 - end date of an event should capture the latest date of an item 

To view the c# code, find the stringcomparison folder and click stringcomparison > Program.cs
The console outputs are:
